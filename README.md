Quant II Final Project (May 2025)

This is the Github Repository for the Quant II Final Project (May 2025). The subject of this project is to examine the reltaionship between residing in a post-communist country in the EU and an individual's perception of a National Sovereignty Deficit (NSD). Drawing on data from the European Social Survey (Round 10), I create a research design that matches individual respondents on key covaraites before assessing the estimated effect of residing in a post-communist country on perceptions of a NSD. I detail several steps of assessing the research design, hypothesis test, and estimator used. 

Data: Download the ESS10 Subset Data from the file entitled: "ESS10-subset.csv." You can assess the ESS codebook for the subset data at the file entitled: "ESS10-subset codebook.html"

Replication: To replicate the data analysis, open and download the R script in the file entitled: "QuantIIFinalCodeOnly.Rmd." Be sure to set the working directory before running. 

Other Files: You can also find a copy of the final pdf for the write-up: "QuantII_FinalVersion.pdf." You can also view the raw code for the pdf: "QuantIIFinal.Rmd."
